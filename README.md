#### Main Technologies 
This assignment focused on Object Oriented Programming, Node.js and Inquire.

#### My Part
Class objects have been created to pre-built Unit Testing and have passed the supplied tests. 

The most of the JS, HTML and testing had been provided as a framework. I focused on the app.js file, class js files and the css file. I also modified some of the html to customize the structure of the page.

#### Future Additions

1. There is a comma that appears between the cards which is most likely an error in one of the JS files. 

2. I would like to add more robust validation for the inquirer prompts, so it is specifics to numbers, emails and urls. At the moment I am just making sure people don't skip an answer.
